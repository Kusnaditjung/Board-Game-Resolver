# Board Game Resolver

One of my friend give a puzzle kit to my kid. The challenge is to remove all the tick from board until it is only one left. 
In life, the board is equilateral triangle (the same size on all sides), however for the simulation (to transfer into an array), 
I arrange the triagle into half size of a square (there is some consequence though, as the diagonal move cannot be down right , or up left).

To start, you need to leave one empty place. 
To move, you need to pass a tick to an empty place, but only if there is a tick in between your tick and the empty place.
You can do this horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

Have a try!
