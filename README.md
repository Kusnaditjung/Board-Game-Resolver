# Board Game Resolver

One of my dear friend gave a puzzle kit to my kid. The challenge is to remove all the tick from board until it is only one left. 
Have trying numerous times myself, I can only get maximal 3 tick left (too bad). So I decide to cheat (by creating this program) and because I understand that the solution spaces will not be exhaustive (the solution spaces for default challenges in this project is 294284) 

In life, the board is equilateral triangle (the same size on all sides), however for the simulation (to transfer into an array), 
I arrange the triagle into half size of a square, in actual board, you cannot move  down right , or up left.

To start, you need to leave one empty place (31 in the default challenge) 
To move, you need to pass a tick to an empty place, but only if there is a tick in between your tick and the empty place.
You can do this horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

Have a try!
